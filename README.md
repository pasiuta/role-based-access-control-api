Sure, here's an example of API documentation for your project:

# RBAC API Documentation
-----------------------

## Overview
-----------
This API allows you to manage users and tasks in an application with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). You can register and login users, and perform CRUD operations on tasks based on user roles and permissions.

## Prerequisites
----------------
1. Install Node.js: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Install MongoDB: [https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
3. Clone the project and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies.
5. Create a `.env` file in the project root to store your environment variables (like your MongoDB URI).

## How to Use
-------------
1. Start your MongoDB server.
2. Run `node index.js` to start the server.
3. Use a tool like Postman or cURL to send requests to the API.

## Endpoints
------------

### Register a User
Send a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/auth/register` with the following data:

```json
{
    "username": "myuser",
    "password": "mypassword",
    "role": "admin"
}
```

### Login a User
Send a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/auth/login` with the following data:

```json
{
    "username": "myuser",
    "password": "mypassword"
}
```

### Access Tasks
Once logged in, you can access the tasks routes under '/tasks'. The server will check the logged-in user's role and permissions before allowing access.

## Checking Data in MongoDB
You can use a MongoDB GUI like MongoDB Compass or Robo 3T to connect to your database and see your data.

Remember to replace the values in the examples with your actual data. ðŸ˜Š# role-based-access-control-api
